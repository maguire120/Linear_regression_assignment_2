## Purpose of Assignment_3
    # For assignment_2 the goal was to read in a set of data, plotting it in a scatter plot using both python and R, and modeling a linear regression to the data and adding it to the visualized plot.
    # Assignment_3 built upon what we made with assignment_2 to make improved plots, and gain more experience with improving scripts and code

## Packages used for the completion of Assignment_2
    #pandas
    #matplotlib
    #scikit-learn
    #scipy
    #ggplot2

## Files found in Assignment_3
    # Linear_regression_pyhton.html - html file of the code used to plot the data set and linear regression model using Python
    # Linear_regression_python.ipynb - Jupyter lab notebook relating to the Linear_regression_python.html code
    # Linear_regression_R.html - html file of the code used to plot the data set and linear regression model using R
    # Linear_regression_R.ipynb - Jupyter lab notebook relating to the Linear_regression_R.html code
    # regression_data.csv - CSV file containing the data in two columns plotted with python and R
    # Linear_regression_Python.py - script written in Python that can run a linear regression of any data set containing 2 columns with the inputs of the input of the data file name, and both column title names
    # Linear_regression_R.r - script written in R that can run a linear regression of any data set containing 2 columns with the inputs of the input of the data file name, and both column title names
    # regression_plot_python.png - image file of the data plot generated from running the script written in R to plot linear regression
    # regression_plot_r.png - image file of the data plot generated from running the script written in R to plot linear regression
    
## Additional purpose to Assignment_3

    # As a part of Assignment_3 the idea of github branches and commit to branch to maintain a previous version of a working file
    # When the branch has been finished and validated to work, is accurate, and has been reviewed the branch can be merged into the main branch while maintaining a version history
