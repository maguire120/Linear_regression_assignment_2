## Purpose of Assignment_2
    # For assignment_2 the goal was to read in a set of data, plotting it in a scatter plot using both python and R, and modeling a linear regression to the data and adding it to the visualized plot.
    # The assignment_2 helped with becoming more familiar with creating notebooks to compile lines of code, and how to export that notebook to an HTML to be read anywhere without a jupyter notebook

## Packages used for the completion of Assignment_2
    #pandas
    #matplotlib
    #scikit-learn
    #scipy
    #ggplot2
