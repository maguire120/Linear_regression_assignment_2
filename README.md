## Purpose of Assignment_2
    # For assignment_2 the goal was to read in a set of data, plotting it in a scatter plot using both python and R, and modeling a linear regression to the data and adding it to the visualized plot.
    # The assignment_2 helped with becoming more familiar with creating notebooks to compile lines of code, and how to export that notebook to an HTML to be read anywhere without a jupyter notebook

## Packages used for the completion of Assignment_2
    #pandas
    #matplotlib
    #scikit-learn
    #scipy
    #ggplot2

## Files found in Assignment_2
    # Linear_regression_pyhton.html - html file of the code used to plot the data set and linear regression model using Python
    # Linear_regression_python.ipynb - Jupyter lab notebook relating to the Linear_regression_python.html code
    # Linear_regression_R.html - html file of the code used to plot the data set and linear regression model using R
    # Linear_regression_R.ipynb - Jupyter lab notebook relating to the Linear_regression_R.html code
    # regression_data.csv - CSV file containing the data in two columns plotted with python and R
    
## Part 2 of Assignment_2
    # The goal of part 2 was to export the notebooks as executable scripts to run in the terminal and generate png images of the resulting graphs
    
## Files added after initial commit
    # Linear_regression_Python.py - executable script using python to read in a set of 2 column data and plot the data with a linear regression model
    # Linear_regression_R.r - executable script using R to read in a set of 2 column data and plot the data with a linear regression model
    # linear_regression_python_output.png - picture of the graph resulting from running the .py script
    # linear_regression_r_output.png - picture of the graph resulting from running the .r script
    # Rplots.pdf - auto generated file from running the .r script, pdf version of the png image obtained from running the script
